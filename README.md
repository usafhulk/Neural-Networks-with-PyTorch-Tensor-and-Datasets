# Deep Learning with PyTorch ‚Äì Practical Notebooks Portfolio

Welcome to my PyTorch notebooks repository ‚Äî a hands-on journey through foundational machine learning concepts using PyTorch, built during my coursework and refined through personal exploration. This collection is designed not only to reinforce core theory but also to bridge the gap between classroom knowledge and real-world business application.

## üîç What's Inside

This repository contains over 20 Jupyter Notebooks covering:

- **Tensors in PyTorch**: 1D & 2D tensor operations and basic tensor mathematics
- **Linear Regression**: From single-parameter models to multi-output predictions
- **Model Training Techniques**:
  - Manual gradient computation
  - Automatic differentiation using PyTorch's autograd
  - Mini-Batch and Stochastic Gradient Descent
  - Loss surface visualizations with custom plotting utilities
- **Validation Workflows**: Creating training/validation splits, identifying overfitting
- **Logistic Regression**:
  - Bad initialization scenarios
  - Cross-entropy loss
  - Binary prediction in classification
- **Dataset Handling**:
  - Custom datasets
  - Built-in PyTorch datasets
  - Data transforms and preprocessing
- **Capstone Project**: A **League of Legends Match Predictor** modeling game outcomes based on team statistics

## üß† Why This Matters

Each notebook demonstrates not only technical proficiency with PyTorch but also a deep understanding of **how models learn**, **why they fail**, and **how to course-correct** ‚Äî which is critical in real-world business environments where stakes are high and experimentation time is limited.

## üè¢ Business Relevance

These concepts are directly applicable to:

- **Customer segmentation** and **churn prediction** using logistic regression
- **Sales forecasting** with linear regression
- **A/B test optimization** using gradient-based methods
- **Performance modeling** for operations and logistics
- **Gaming & Sports analytics** (e.g., the League of Legends capstone)

Each notebook could be extended into scalable pipelines for deployment, making them not just academic exercises but prototypes for production.

## üéØ Why This Is a Strong Portfolio Entry

- ‚úÖ **Depth of Understanding**: Demonstrates my comfort working from scratch, tuning models manually before relying on automation.
- ‚úÖ **Code Quality**: Clear, annotated, and modular code that is readable and adaptable.
- ‚úÖ **Realism**: Mimics iterative, trial-and-error development found in business settings.
- ‚úÖ **Storytelling with Data**: Combines visualization with explanation to tell the "why" behind the results.
- ‚úÖ **Reusable Utilities**: Includes custom Python classes (e.g., for plotting loss surfaces) that reflect software design thinking.
